color Clear diamonds are graded D-Z. The higher letters more yellowish but are often better values since color is hard to determine once in a ring.
clarity refers the inclusions (i.e., internal flaws) in the diamonds seen though a jewelers loupe or microscope. Fewer and smaller are better.
carat_weight Refers to the mass of the diamond. It's loosely connected with dimension of a diamond but cut and cut_quality tends to play an equally large if not larger role.
cut_quality refers the GIA Cut Grading System which was developed in 2005 and is de facto standard.
lab is the grading lab. The big three are GIA, IGI and HRD. Each diamond gets a lab certificate that looks like this.

culet_size is the size of the circle you'd see if you looked straight down. None is ideal because it affects the amount of light that gets reflected.
culet_condition indicates if the culet has any chipping, which is why some diamonds don't close to a point but rather a very small flat spot.
fancy_color_ columns have to do with colored diamonds. Formerly, extremely rare but now common, popular, and almost always lab grown.
fluor columns refer to the effect of long wave UV light. According to GIA 25-35% have it; for ~10% of those it's noticeable to an expert.

meas_length, meas_width, meas_depth are the absolute measurements of stone.
girdle min/max are where the id of a stone is engraved they also are where the meets the setting and play a role in reflection. There are 9 values ranging from extremely thin to extremely thick
