clarity refers the inclusions (i.e., internal flaws) in the diamonds seen though a jewelers loupe or microscope. Fewer and smaller are better.

cut_quality refers the GIA Cut Grading System which was developed in 2005 and is de facto standard.
lab is the grading lab. The big three are GIA, IGI and HRD. Each diamond gets a lab certificate that looks like this.
